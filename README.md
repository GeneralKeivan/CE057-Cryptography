## Introduction

Welcome to the Cryptography course repository on GitHub! This repository is a central location for all the materials related to the course, including lecture notes, assignments, code samples, and other resources to help you learn the fundamental concepts of cryptography.

Cryptography is the science of secure communication, which involves techniques for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information. Cryptography has become an essential tool for ensuring the security of digital communication and transactions, with applications ranging from online banking and e-commerce to national security and privacy. In this course, you will learn the basics of cryptography, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, digital signatures, hash functions, and key exchange protocols. You will also have the opportunity to apply your knowledge to real-world problems, such as designing secure communication systems and cracking encrypted messages.

The repository is organized into different folders, each containing resources related to a particular topic or aspect of cryptography. You will find lecture notes, slides, and code samples in the "lectures" folder, while assignments and projects will be located in the "assignments" folder. There is also a "resources" folder that contains additional materials such as books, papers, and links to useful online resources.

We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for you throughout the course and beyond. Let's explore the fascinating world of cryptography together!
